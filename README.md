# Computational Design Capabilities Graph
## Overview
This repository contains an interactive Computational Design Capabilities Graph, which visualises our teamâ€™s expertise, the tools we've developed, and how they connect to different project stages. The goal is to help the wider team understand where and how computational design can be applied, as well as who to contact for further details.
